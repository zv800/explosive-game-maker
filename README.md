# Using EGM

Getting started with EGM Alpha is simple! There are a few prerequisites and they are the .Net frame 4.5 which is free and can be downloaded here: [http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=30653](http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=30653)

Download the archive of EGM, it’s a .zip so you should be able to extract it to a folder. There is one exe in the root of the folder and that is **Explosive Game Maker.exe** double-click on this to run the game maker. 

When you run EGM you are prompted  by a couple dialogs, the first is the tips system, this is shown when the program starts to give you tips on using the game maker and this is of course optional. You can disable tips by checking the box on the tips system or by going to Edit > Global Settings > Tips. 

After you close the tips system the next is the **New Project** menu. From here you can see all your recent projects, create a new project or open one of the included samples. There are currently three samples and they show off using some of the language used in EGM and demonstrate how easy it is to use EGM. Create a new project by clicking **Blank EGM Project. **

Now you are seeing the grey game maker. In the alpha version the visual designer is not ready so we must use the script editor. Everything in EGM is universal, as in – you only have one sprite window, one script editor etc. Click **Create > Script.** You will then see the script editor with two tabs and a menu. The first tab is for functions and local declarations etc. and the second tab is for subroutines, since you can’t compile sub routines inside of a subroutine. Later versions of EGM will support multiple classes and be more robust with this. 

To make it easier using some of the classes in EGM you can go to **Insert > something** in the script editor. When you insert something it will automatically place it in the correct tab for you. If you want to know about the language used in the script editor you can read the **Documentation**  which can be found in the Script Editor by clicking **Help Documentation** or on the main interface go to **Help > Documentation. **

To create a sprite go to **Create > Sprite.** It’s pretty straightforward we have a sprite name and the sprite file. Click add sprite and browse to the location of your sprite, you will then see a preview of it, its x and y dimensions. You must give your sprite a name i.e. **sprCharacter** or **sprEnemy.** When you change the name of the sprite click Update, then click Ok to close the dialog. 

Note: When drawing a sprite, to specify which sprite to draw the first parameter of the call is “yourSpritename”, if your sprite does not have a name or you don’t type the name correctly it won’t be drawn.

It would be a big help to me if you use the Feedback feature in EGM. I need everyone to let me know which bugs you find, what suggestions you have/how I can improve EGM or anything else. To do this on the main interface click **Help > Feedback,** or contact me from one the links above.
